# Election_analysis
Python Module
## Overview
---
This dataset contains the ballot ID, County name, and Canditate name. There are 3 counties: Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe. There are also three canditates: Charles Casper Stockham, Diana DeGette, and Raymon Anythony Doane. The purpose of this analysis is to determine which county had the largest number of ballot votes, as well as the candidate twith the largest number of ballot votes. With this dataset, we will determine which candidate won the election, based of total percentages. Additionally, we will determine how many votes each county had, as well as the percentage of votes from each county. With the use of python, we will run analysis on this data to determine the election results. We will create lists, dictionaries, for loops, common operators, decision statements, and then print the statement. By reading in the election results csv, we will be able to manipulate the dataset to print in a way that makes sense to us and the general public to clearly see who the winner of the election is.
